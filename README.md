[**mootmoart**](https://mootmoart.now.sh) takes a screenshot of [eb.dk](https://eb.dk) two times a day then runs through and analyzes every face in every image and catalogues their emotions as a computer sees them.

I built it for my comedy show _Ny Mappe (1)_.

I was going to call it mootboart but I hit the wrong key.
